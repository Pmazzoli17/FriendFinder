# FriendFinder

This app is a compatibility-based "FriendFinder" application. (basically a dating app)  The site takes in results from users' surveys, then compares their answers with those from other users. The app then displays the name and picture of the user with the best overall match.

Express was used to handle routing and the app was deployed using Heroku.
